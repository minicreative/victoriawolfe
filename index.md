images and sound

![](uploads/VictoriaWolfe.png)

I write and create with video and sound. My themes are environmental activism and urban realism.

**my writing:** As a teenager I had an impactful professional experience - two summers of mentorship in a top cosmetics firm from a corporate manager, Jeannine Boullier, who survived the WWII Paris Occupation. The colors, sounds and scents - an immersive French Manhattan environment - plus the German and Austrian 20th Century art on the walls gave me an expansive understanding that thereafter defined what I would write: humorous, dark, luxe themes of struggle, rebellion and bathos.

**my visuals:** I conjure the Peter Max graphic art that saturated my first years living in Manhattan as a child. A Nam June Paik retrospective at the Whitney Museum and my father's exploration of creative audio cassette recording drew me to analog and digital video creating.

**my sound:** I create from my own archive that includes a poet reading his work aloud; original field recordings in an urban setting; eccentric tune curation; my own clinking around on a 1980s Yamaha synthesizer. These soundscapes bring the viewer more fully into the image. Cassette recordings I made with my father, the Beatles Sgt Pepper Album, Edgard Varese and John Cage, and a vinyl recording of Eudora Welty reading her hilarious, poignant story The Petrified Man.

All of my time-based art came from a desire to include video projection in my plays. I found myself writing moving images into the scripts. After studying archives of Super8 home movies and art films for many years, I developed conceptually and decided to make my own. I've lived a bi-coastal life over the last 25 years, and that gives me access to varied color palettes and differing natural light in New York City versus Northern California.

Rich color schemes, post-mod neon and lush black-and-white references to mid-century Italian cinema inspire me.

Central Park Bench Maquette, foam core board, August 2009

Sound Installation, *Excerpt, Central Park, NYC, August 8, 2009*, Memory/Frequency exhibition October 2009 at Worksound in
Portland, OR, shown by sound recorder Tracey Cockrell - from *Reservoir Runner Bench Installation* by Victoria Wolfe

"The most satisfying work though is \[the] sound installation, *Excerpt, Central Park, NYC, August 8, 2009*. A simple corner piled with cedar chips and a park bench invites visitors to sit and listen. . .Most of the sounds are simply those of people rushing by but the snippets of conversations are suggested. Only one regarding someone's "meanness" is all that intelligible and the mind races while trying to string together some coherent
narrative, this too is apophenia inducing." (Jeff Jahn, PortlandArt.net, October 19, 2009)
